## üìä Data Format

The application expects candidate data in the following JSON structure:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Candidate Name",
    "location": "City, Country",
    "annual_salary_expectation": {
      "full-time": "$95,000"
    },
    "education": {
      "highest_level": "Bachelor's Degree"
    },
    "skills": ["Python", "React", "AWS"],
    "work_experiences": [
      {
        "roleName": "Senior Software Engineer",
        "company": "Tech Company"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## üß† Scoring Algorithm

The candidate scoring system evaluates multiple dimensions:

- **Skills Match** (40%): Alignment with role-specific skill requirements
- **Experience Level** (25%): Seniority and relevant work history
- **Company Background** (15%): Previous company reputation and scale
- **Education** (10%): Academic qualifications and institution quality
- **Geographic Diversity** (10%): Regional balance for team composition

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Roles
Modify the `ROLE_KEYWORDS` dictionary in `app.py` to include new role categories and their associated skills.

### Adjusting Scoring Weights
Modify the scoring algorithm in the `score_candidate` function to adjust the importance of different factors.

### Styling Changes
Edit `styles.css` to customize the visual appearance of the application.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `app.py` or stop other services using port 5000
2. **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all required Python packages are installed
3. **File upload errors**: Check that your JSON file is properly formatted

### Performance Tips

- For large datasets (>1000 candidates), consider processing in batches
- Use the notebook version for detailed analysis of smaller candidate pools
- Enable browser caching for better performance with repeated uploads
